This is my ongoing first attempt at an implementation of AES in C. 

At the moment, I have a number of the steps complete, and some of the control flow of the program is set
in place. 

I will continue to update this as I work on it. 

The big parts which I have yet to complete are:

1) The key expansion algorithm
2) The inverse round operations
3) Establishing control flow of the rounds themselves. 
4) Key generation based on user input for key size, and applying the appropriate key for Decrypt()

Thank you for your interest!
